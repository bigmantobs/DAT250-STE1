# DAT250 Software Experiment Assignment 3: MongoDB
The purpose of this report is to document the installation and testing of MongoDB on my personal computer. Furthermore the report will seek to record an aggragation section. More on that will follow.

## Installation 
During installation there were no actual problems. Only issue I had to report on, lies in the verification of the installation. In the tutorial we were instructed to download the sha256 hash file for version 5.0.2 of MongoDB, and so when I compared the two hash' I was met with False. (I used powershell, didn't know if we were supposed to use anything else.)

The fix for this was as easy as changing the 5.0.2 to a 5.0.3 in the URL for the download.

## Introductory CRUD operations
The first instruction was to use insertOne and insertMany.
