# DAT250 Heroku Trials
The purpose of this report is to document the installation and trial process of Heroku. From start to finish, there were very few problems, and problems that arose were easy to fix, or at some times even fixed themselves. The first thing to do was install the prerequisite software, which I had already installed on my machine from prior necessity. 

## Testing
After installing, verifying the functionality of the software was as easy as just beginning the tutorial (following of course a few version checks via the terminal). Although the prerequisite check-up went smoothly, a few issues were raised during the Heroku installation process. One of which was up to my own blunder, I spent some time looking into syntax errors in my Java IDE, rather than compiling and then reading errors from the terminal. For example: the imports I added to Main.java, were initially flagged as unrecognized, but upon compiling, it was not an issue. 

Following this first “issue”, a second flag was raised when I tried to install the addon via the terminal command. The terminal prompted me to add my credit card information to the Heroku website. After a good laugh I caved in and added the information to the site, and was able to install the addon with no problem (and no charges on my card). 

Thus, PaperTrail was up and running and after some short database work, so was my Heroku page, which can be found at by clicking [Heroku Page](https://ancient-lowlands-88802.herokuapp.com/)

## Unsolved Issues
One issue I never managed to solve was my Heroku pg:psql command not working, I installed, restarted, and still I am met with an error. I will try a re-install.
