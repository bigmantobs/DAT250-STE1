# DAT250 Software Experiment Assignment 5
## Background
This report will seek to document the fifth software experiment assignment in Dat250. The objective of the assignment was to familiarize ourselves 
with Spring.io, by creating projects using the framework.

## Technical Problems
Had an issue with the port as I was running an apache HTTP server there, and I could not figure out how to change the port in the spring initializer so I was forced to turn off my server to proceed.
