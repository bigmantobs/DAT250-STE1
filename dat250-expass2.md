# DAT250 Database Experimentation
## Introduction
The purpose of this report is to document the learning and implementation of Java Persistence API. The first difficulty I had with this experiment was one I brought upon myself, I had started the experiment too late (I have been somewhat ill this weekend, and this has limited my workrate), but then I encountered a number of technical difficulties which made the experiment more challenging than need be. Unfortunately, at this point in time I am still unable to generate any database reports with my model, meeting a number of errors in my IDE terminal. I shall go to a lab session this week and see if I may be guided to a functional experiment.

## Inspection of Data Tables
W.I.P. - as I haven't been able to successfully generate any data tables, other than those few from the tutorial, this part will come soon. Assume, for now, that all tables are to be inspected via derby's ij command in terminal.

## Unsolved Issues
- Unable to generate database logs.
- Unable to view database logs in the terminal using ij.
