# DAT250 Software Experiment Assignment 4
## Technical Issues
Initially when I loaded the project into intellij I was not able to import maven. Something about "pom.xml" not being found. Confused by this, I looked through the project 
files and found the pom.xml inside the project, and after bringing this out to the same directory as the .gitignore, I was able to load the maven structure for the project.
Additionally, I was unable to run the program on the standard port, 8080, as I have an apache server running on that port. Therefore I used port 8088 instead.
Furthermore, postman kept returning something about localhost requests not being supported when I was doing the first experiment. I downloaded the desktop client and it fixed the issue.

## Experiment Two

None.
